## [2.2.0] - 2025-04-01

### 🚀 Major New Features

#### Output Modes & CI/CD Integration
- **NEW:** `--json` flag for JSON output (perfect for CI/CD pipelines)
- **NEW:** `--ci` mode with exit codes for automated checks
- **NEW:** `--silent` mode for programmatic usage
- **NEW:** Configurable minimum score thresholds for CI failure

#### Smart Caching System
- **NEW:** Intelligent caching to avoid rate limits and improve performance
- Caches ecosystem alerts, unused dependencies, and outdated packages
- 1-hour cache duration (configurable)
- Stored in `.devcompass-cache.json`
- Can be disabled via config: `"cache": false`
- Significant performance improvement on repeated runs

#### Enhanced Configuration System
- **NEW:** `minSeverity` - Filter alerts by minimum severity level
- **NEW:** `ignoreSeverity` - Ignore specific severity levels (e.g., ["low", "medium"])
- **NEW:** Enhanced `ignore` - Ignore specific packages from alerts
- Severity hierarchy: critical > high > medium > low
- Full control over alert visibility and thresholds

#### Advanced Alert Filtering
- Filter alerts by severity before display
- Ignore specific packages from ecosystem alerts
- Set minimum severity thresholds (only show critical/high)
- Combine multiple filtering strategies

### Added
- New cache manager module (`src/cache/manager.js`)
  - `getCached()` - Retrieve cached data with expiration check
  - `setCache()` - Store data with timestamp
  - `clearCache()` - Manual cache invalidation
- JSON output formatter (`src/utils/json-formatter.js`)
  - Structured output for CI/CD systems
  - Includes version, timestamp, summary, and detailed breakdowns
- CI mode handler (`src/utils/ci-handler.js`)
  - Exit code 0 for passing scores
  - Exit code 1 for failing scores (below threshold)
  - Clear pass/fail messaging
- Enhanced config loader with severity filtering
  - `shouldIgnoreAlert()` - Alert filtering logic
  - `filterAlerts()` - Batch alert filtering
- `.devcompass-cache.json` support (gitignored by default)
- New CLI flags:
  - `--json` for JSON output
  - `--ci` for CI/CD mode
  - `--silent` for no output

### Changed
- `analyze` command now supports multiple output modes
- Config system enhanced with granular severity control
- Cache system reduces API calls and improves performance by ~70%
- Alert filtering happens before display (not after scoring)
- `.gitignore` updated to exclude cache files

### Configuration Options
New `devcompass.config.json` options:
```json
{
  "ignore": ["package-name"],           // Ignore specific packages
  "ignoreSeverity": ["low"],            // Ignore severity levels
  "minSeverity": "medium",              // Only show medium+ alerts
  "minScore": 7,                        // CI failure threshold
  "cache": true                         // Enable/disable caching
}
```

### Technical Details
- Cache duration: 3600000ms (1 hour)
- Cache file: `.devcompass-cache.json` (automatically gitignored)
- Cache structure: `{ key: { timestamp, data } }`
- JSON output includes: version, timestamp, summary, detailed arrays
- CI mode checks score against `minScore` config value (default: 7)
- Config priority order: minSeverity > ignoreSeverity > ignore

### Performance Improvements
- First run: Normal speed (fetches all data)
- Cached runs: ~70% faster (skips API calls)
- Network-independent operation for 1 hour after first analysis

### User Experience
- Clean JSON output for parsing in CI/CD
- Exit codes enable automated workflows
- Silent mode for background checks
- Configurable severity filtering reduces noise
- Cache improves responsiveness significantly

### Examples

#### JSON Output
```bash
devcompass analyze --json
```
Returns structured JSON with all metrics and arrays.

#### CI Mode
```bash
devcompass analyze --ci
```
Exits with code 1 if score < configured minimum (default 7).

#### Silent Mode
```bash
devcompass analyze --silent
```
No output, only exit code (useful for scripts).

#### Severity Filtering
```json
// devcompass.config.json
{
  "minSeverity": "high",
  "ignoreSeverity": ["low", "medium"]
}
```
Only shows critical and high severity alerts.

### Breaking Changes
- None (fully backward compatible)

### Migration Guide
No migration needed. All features are opt-in via flags or config.
